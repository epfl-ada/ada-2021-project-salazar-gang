# *Social context influence on views on climate change*
# Abstract
<div style="text-align: right">Nowadays, man-made climate change and global warming have become an emergency that goes far beyond national boundaries and certainly represent one of the greatest challenges humankind has ever faced. In fact, because of direct consequences like heat waves, more frequent and intense storms, rising sea levels, warming of the oceans and many others, humans, but most importantly animals, face new challenges for survival. In order to limit as much as possible the damages, concrete actions need to be undertaken. However, identifying the factors that influence public views on climate change is a crucial step to urge politics to propose solutions on the matter and convince the population to act daily. We therefore decided to evaluate the influence of the social context (age, academic degree, profession, political partyâ€¦) on the opinions of climate change using the QuoteBank dataset to answer several questions listed below.</div>
